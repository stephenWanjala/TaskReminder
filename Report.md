- User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and interaction patterns.

## Design
The design of Task Reminder focuses on simplicity and usability. Key design elements include:
- Use of Material Design principles for a modern and intuitive user interface.
- RecyclerView for displaying tasks in a list format.
- Color-coded indicators for task status (e.g., red for overdue, green for completed).

## Implementation and Testing
The implementation of Task Reminder involves:
- Using Java programming language for Android development.
- Leveraging Android Studio and Gradle for project setup and dependency management.
- Utilizing Room database for local data storage and management.
- Implementing RecyclerView adapters and item interactions for task list functionality.
